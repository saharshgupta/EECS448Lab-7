Bugs:
-isEmpty always returns true
-addBack doesn't add to the end of the list, it adds to the front of the list.
-removeBack and removeFront do not remove an element from the list. They return false for everything.

Causes:
-isEmpty always returning true might be why removeFront and removeBack always returns false and do not remove an element.
